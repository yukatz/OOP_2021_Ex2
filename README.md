## ***Classes:***
- [x] **Node Data**
  > Represents vertex of Directed Weighted Graph - construct of key and location.
- [x] Edge Data
  > Represents edges of Directed Weighted Graph - construct of source, destination and weight.
- [x] Geo Location
  > Represents Graph nodes position by x, y .
- [x] Directed Weighted Graph
  > Represents Graph by Lists of Nodes and Edges. For list we used Hash map. Edge list built from hash map of hash maps.
- [x] Directed Weighted Graph Algorithms:
  > Represents algorithms that can be used on directed graph:
    - > 1.represent if the graph is connected.
    - > 2.represent the shortest path between source and destination given nodes.
    -  > 3.represent the shortest path in the graph between vertex.
     - > 4.represent the center of the graph.
     - > 5.represent a solution to tsp problem.




## ***Results:***

| Number of Nodes  | Is connected | Shortest Path  | Shortest Path Distenation | Center | Tsp |
| ---------------  | ------------ | -------------  | ------------------------- | -------|-----|
|   1,000 Nodes    | Content Cell |  Content Cell  | Content Cell              | Cell   | Cell|
|   10,000 Nodes   | Content Cell |  Content Cell  | Content Cell              | Cell   | Cell|
|  100,000 Nodes   | Content Cell |  Content Cell  | Content Cell              | Cell   | Cell|
| 1,000,000 Nodes  |              |  Content Cell  | Content Cell              | Cell   | Cell|
